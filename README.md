# youtube-elements-blocker

This is a Chrome extension I've developed that hides undesirable parts of Youtube from view.

In order to use it for yourself:
1) Clone this repository with git clone [this repository]
2) Turn on 'developer mode' on your chrome browser (or any other browser built on chromium, such as Brave)
