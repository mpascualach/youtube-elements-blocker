# youtube-elements-blocker

This is a Chrome extension I've developed that hides undesirable parts of Youtube from view.

In order to use it for yourself:
  1) Clone this repository with git clone [this repository]
  2) Turn on 'developer mode' on your chrome browser (or any other browser built on chromium, such as Brave)
  3) Upload this project as an extensoin for your browser using 'load unpacked'
  4) Enjoy a less overwhelming experience watching videos on Youtube!

A few next steps for me to consider:
  1) How to disable elements within iframes containing Youtube videos
  2) Letting users choose which parts of Youtube they would like to hide from view
